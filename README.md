# Local Educational Affordable Chatbot (LEAC)

This repository is a summer science project. For the project, I downloaded Ollama and three LLMs (Gemma, Llama, and DeepSeek) onto a Raspberry Pi with a battery and a portable battery to make it portable. 

## Steps taken
Downloaded Gemma, Llama, and DeepSeek for different subjects because DeepSeek is good at math but bad at history, and Gemma for Language Arts, because it's good at explaining thoroughly

## Experiments
Found out that DeepSeek can't say anything about Chinese history (ex. Tiananmen Square)
Found out that Llama's bad at math
